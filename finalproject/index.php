 	We understand that many of you who want to learn Web Design and Web Development are beginners.<br>

Jumping into something new and strange is difficult, but at the same time, it has a sense of excitement and wonder.<br>

Internet Academy's courses are designed by experienced Web Professionals who are at the forefront of their field. The material is then edited, tested and revised to ensure that it captures your interest and is easy to pick up and learn.<br>

We not only provide you with the knowledge to succeed but also impart vital skills that are highly sought after by potential employers.

Our whole education process is designed to close the gap between freshers and professionals.<br>

We believe that state-of-the-art technology is useless without the knowledge on how to use it. In the field, knowledge and practical application are equally important and symbiotic.<br>

Internet Academy has been a member of the Word Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since 2000. This relationship allows us to craft our classes with the latest developments in the Web.<br>

In addition, we are a global company with branch offices in New York, Boston, Bangalore and Tokyo. Our presence in these IT-centric cities allows us to stay in tune with the latest trends in the industry.<br>
Your journey at Internet Academy starts with a session with our Course Counsellors, who will work with you to create a path that helps you best.<br>

Every course has dedicated practice lessons and project development sessions, which gives you an additional platform to interact with your Instructors and clear up any questions you may have.<br>

We make sure that you have full access to resources that will help you understand the real-world applications of everything that you learn here.<br>
Tell us what you're looking for. Meet our Course Coordinator and attend a free lesson to see how our classes work. Let us help you create the best learning program to suit your needs.
We are frequently contacted by various corporations regarding the availability and technical expertise of graduates from Internet Academy. In such cases, we will provide you with an opportunity to meet the concerned representatives of the company.<br>

Using the skills and pointers acquired from the career counselling session, we are confident that you will be able to excel at the interview!<br>
After your courses, you can either go forth and grow in the Web field as a Developer or Designer, or you can learn more specialisations from us to quickly climb the ranks in the Web Industry.<br>
